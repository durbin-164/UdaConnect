Person database will use for only person information and Location database will use for only Person visit information.
If Udaconnect have millions of users then separated database will help to load balancing.

Only connection-api microservice will use for external application Udaconnect frontend that's why this
microservice is REST. And person service use gRPC technology as an internal API. Though location-api microservice
used REST but we can also make it gRPC because it is also an internal API.

When Udaconnect have millions of user, user visit information will huge. To store this huge visit information needs
robost technology. That`s why here used Kafka server. A gRPC API get request for storing user visit information,
and then it will produce it for kafka server. Then a kafka consumer one by one receive this messages and store it
in location database.
